# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

The **Iris Flower Classification** project uses the famous Iris dataset to train a machine learning model that can classify iris flowers into one of three species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** — based on their measurements.

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Total Samples:** 150 (50 per species)
- **Features:**
  1. Sepal length (cm)
  2. Sepal width (cm)
  3. Petal length (cm)
  4. Petal width (cm)
- **Target:** Species label (0 = Setosa, 1 = Versicolor, 2 = Virginica)

The dataset is clean and balanced, making it ideal for learning and testing classification algorithms.

## 🎯 Objective
To train a machine learning model that can predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Exploration** – Load and inspect dataset structure.
2. **Preprocessing** – Standardize features and split into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training** – Train models like:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. **Evaluation** – Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Prediction** – Test the model on new/unseen data.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3**
- **pandas** – Data handling
- **scikit-learn** – ML algorithms & evaluation
- **matplotlib** – Data visualization

## 📈 Results
With proper preprocessing and tuning, the model achieves **95–100% accuracy** on the test dataset, showing the effectiveness of simple classification algorithms on structured data.
